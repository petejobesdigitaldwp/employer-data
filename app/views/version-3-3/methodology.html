        <p class="govuk-body">

            We source the data in <strong>Find data on employers</strong> from <strong>Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC)</strong>. It represents data taken from <strong>P45/P46 and P14</strong> records. These records summarise a person's employment at three points: when they end a job, start a job, or every year during their employment.             
        </p><p class="govuk-body">The data applies to the tax year from <strong>April 2015 to March 2016</strong>. It lists each employment spell (a person may have more than one job at once) as a record. Each record also shows the gross pay (before tax and other deductions) earned by an individual from their employer during the year. 

        </p><p class="govuk-body">Data is handled very carefully by DWP. Data used to provide this service is subject to a <a class="govuk-link" href="Memorandum of understanding">memorandum of understanding</a> (MoU) between HMRC and DWP. This MoU controls how we can use the data.
